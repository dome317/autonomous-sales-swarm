Simulate a lead through the Sales Swarm pipeline. Generate a realistic B2B company lead, then trace its path through every agent:

1. Generate a random lead from the test profiles (use test-simulator subagent)
2. Show what the Supervisor would decide (route + reasoning)
3. Show Lead Intelligence enrichment output
4. Show Qualification scoring (score + tier + reasoning)
5. Show Outreach draft (email or message)
6. If "won": show Onboarding output
7. Show what the Self-Improvement loop would learn from this lead

Format: Walk through each step with the actual JSON in/out, as if watching the n8n execution log. Highlight any issues or edge cases found.

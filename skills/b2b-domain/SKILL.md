# B2B SaaS Domain Knowledge

## Key Terminology
- **Proposal Conversion**: Rate at which sent proposals/quotes are accepted — THE core pain point. Average conversion rate is only 25-40%. The product helps increase this.
- **Operations Manager**: Primary user persona, handles admin/scheduling/client communication
- **Enterprise**: Multi-location business, enterprise segment with complex needs
- **CRM**: Customer Relationship Management software (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce, Pipedrive)
- **Follow-up Reminders**: Automated reminder system for pending proposals and client touchpoints
- **Intake Form**: Digital client onboarding form (replaces paper-based processes)
- **No-Show**: Missed appointments (avg. 8-15% in service businesses, significant revenue loss per no-show)

## Common Pain Points (use in qualification + outreach)
1. Low proposal conversion ("Clients don't follow through on proposals")
2. High no-show rate ("Too many missed appointments")
3. Paper-based processes ("Still using spreadsheets and paper forms")
4. Staff overload ("Operations team has no time for follow-ups")
5. Poor client communication ("Clients can't reach us easily")
6. GDPR/Compliance concerns ("We're unsure about data handling")
7. Software fatigue ("Already tried three tools, none worked")
